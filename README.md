# Water-jug-problem
Water jug problem in Artificial Intelligence is defined for 2 and 3 jugs. There is no general solution for more than three water jug problem.
The main objective of the project is to make general algorithm to solve water jug problem for more than 3 jugs.
Heuristic function and heuristic search techniques approach is used to achieve the general solution.
